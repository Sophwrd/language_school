            <h4>You may be wondering, why Language School 2.0?</h4>
            <div class="text">
                This project began with Code First Girls and the first version 1.0
                of this website was created by three enthusiastic members, including
                Aliza Aamir, Winfred Kabuya, and myself, Sophie Ward.
                <br>
                The goal of this project was to provide easy access to free online 
                educational videos to our users. This is because we find languages
                to be incredibly useful, interesting and important in understanding
                the people and cultures around us. In the 2.0 version of Language School, 
                there are some important changes, but the goal remains the same. Here is 
                what has changed in the 2.0 version: <b>the layout of the website</b>, <b>
                    a green aesthetic</b>, <b>the implementation of JavaScript</b>, and
                    <b>a functional contact page</b>.
                <br>
                These changes have been made to fit my personal preferences for
                a website on language learning. However, I 
                do not in any way claim the 2.0 version to be better than the previous one. 
                The 2.0 version is simply a reflection of my preferences and testing out new 
                layouts with JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

                    <div class="text">I am a girl from Switzerland who is always on the look-out for something
                    new to learn. My main areas of interest are creating games and websites. 
                    I love the creativity and freedom these offer. I currently teach programming
                    to young children where they create their own 2D video game and it is always 
                    a pleasure to see how much enjoyment they get out of these lessons.
                    <br>
                    And you know what? I feel that way too about my projects! Are they the best?
                    No. Do they appeal to everyone? No, again. At the moment, I am only looking to 
                    experiment and learn new things in programming, and I am happy always proud to
                    have learned something new during my projects.
                    <br>
                    I believe that pride and joy are two of the most important things when learning 
                    something new which motivates you to keep on learning and improving. The proof 
                    is right here, on this website ;)
